                               <h3>For Strawberry Sauce:</h3>
                               <ul>
                                   <li>1 to 1 1/4 cups halved, fresh strawberries</li>
                                   <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>

                           </ul>
                           <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                           <ul>
                               <li>For the crust: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray; line the bottom with a round of parchment paper; and spray the paper with cooking spray. Place the pan on a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil and bring the foil up around the sides to enclose the seam between the bottom and the sides of the pan.*</li>
                               <li>Stir together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the melted butter and mix until the crumbs are coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Set aside.</li>
                               <li>For the filling: In a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese together with the sour cream. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla, and beat until smooth.</li>
                               <li>Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Set the foil-wrapped pan inside a larger pan, and carefully pour 1/2 inch of warm water into the larger pan to create a water bath. Bake for 1 hour. Turn off the oven, open the oven door, and let the cheesecake stand in the opened oven for 1 hour. Refrigerate the cheesecake for 2 hours or overnight before removing it from the pan.*</li>
                               <li>For the sauce: Process the strawberries, sugar, and lime zest in a food processor or blender until smooth. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. (The sauce is best served cold from the refrigerator.)</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Tips:</h3>
                           <ul>
                               <li>*Put a piece of tinfoil around the bottom of the springform pan and put another piece all the way around, at least halfway up the pan, including the bottom to prevent leaks into the crust.</li>
                               <li>*I find that for the best results, leave the cheesecake in the pan overnight.</li>

                           <h2>CREDIT TO Raleigh Wallace</h2>
                           <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                           <ul>
                               <li>12 oz any kind of flavored chocolate bar.* </li>
                               <li>12 oz (approximate) regular chocolate (milk, white, or dark, but with no extra flavoring)</li>
                               <li>4-6 oz heavy whipping cream, depending on how soft you want your truffle to be.*</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                           <ul>
                               <li>Break the 12 oz of flavored chocolate into pieces and lay it out in a pan that’s at least a few inches deep.</li>
                               <li>Heat the heavy whipping cream on medium/medium-high heat, stirring continuously, until it just starts to bubble. Make sure it does not burn. OR heat in the microwave, stirring every 10-15 seconds, until it is warm enough to melt the chocolate.</li>
                               <li>Pour the heavy whipping cream over the flavored chocolate and wait for a few minutes so the chocolate can melt. Then stir the mixture until it is smooth.</li>
                               <li>Put the mixture into the fridge or freezer until it is solid enough to form into balls.</li>
                               <li>Melt the plain chocolate. Roll the truffles into balls and dip them in the plain chocolate, then put the balls back into the fridge.*
                               </li>
                               <li>Wait for the plain chocolate to solidify.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Notes:</h3>
                           <ul>
                               <li>*I have tried this with dark chocolate caramel Ghirardelli bars, white chocolate caramel Ghirardelli bars, and Endangered Species Forest Mint bars, and they have all turned out well.</li>
                               <li>*Make sure you have at least twice as much flavored chocolate as heavy whipping cream!</li>
                               <li>*If you have made very thick truffles (with very little whipping cream), you can skip coating them in plain chocolate, if you prefer.</li>
